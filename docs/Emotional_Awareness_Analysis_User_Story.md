# User Story: Emotional Awareness & Analysis

**As a** user focused on my emotional well-being and self-reflection,
**I want** the MindfulMoments.io application to comprehensively analyze my emotional state using multi-modal inputs (video, voice, text) and present this information through an intuitive emotional check-in system, complete with historical tracking and clear emoji representations,
**So that** I can gain deeper insights into my emotional patterns over time, identify potential triggers or influences (like weather), understand my emotional responses more clearly, and cultivate greater self-awareness to improve my overall mental wellness and emotional balance.
