# User Story: Mirror Steward Integration

**As a** user seeking empathetic support and deeper self-understanding,
**I want** MindfulMoments.io to feature a "Mirror Steward" AI companion that leverages my advanced memory and emotional context to facilitate self-reflection, track my personal narratives, assist with journaling, and offer tools to mindfully re-author patterns it observes,
**So that** I can feel understood, gain new perspectives on my experiences, cultivate positive changes in my thought patterns, and build a supportive relationship with an AI that truly adapts to my journey.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1.  **AI Companion Persona:**
    *   [ ] The Mirror Steward AI embodies a supportive, gentle, and reflective persona as defined in project documentation (e.g., [`Mirror Steward Persona v1.0.pdf`](Mirror Steward Persona v1.0.pdf:0)).
    *   [ ] The AI's communication style is consistently empathetic, non-judgmental, and encouraging.

2.  **Facilitation of Self-Reflection:**
    *   [ ] The AI can ask open-ended, reflective questions based on the user's current emotional state, recent activities, or past memories (from the five-vector memory).
    *   [ ] The AI can guide users through simple reflective exercises.
    *   [ ] The AI avoids giving direct advice unless specifically designed for certain interventions (e.g., "429 Protection").

3.  **Narrative Tracking:**
    *   [ ] The AI can identify recurring themes, emotional patterns, or narratives in the user's interactions and journal entries over time.
    *   [ ] The AI can gently bring these observed narratives to the user's attention for reflection (e.g., "I've noticed you often mention X when you're feeling Y. What are your thoughts on that?").

4.  **Journaling Assistance:**
    *   [ ] The application provides a dedicated journaling interface.
    *   [ ] The Mirror Steward AI can offer prompts for journaling based on recent events, emotions, or user goals.
    *   [ ] Users can choose to share journal entries with the AI for deeper reflection or keep them private. (Clear consent mechanisms are required).

5.  **Re-authoring AI-Held Memory Patterns (Cognitive Restructuring Support):**
    *   [ ] When the AI identifies a potentially unhelpful or negative pattern (based on its memory of user interactions/emotions), it can offer the user an opportunity to explore and re-frame that pattern.
    *   [ ] This feature is presented as a collaborative exploration, not a directive.
    *   [ ] The AI can guide the user through simple cognitive restructuring techniques (e.g., identifying alternative perspectives, challenging negative thoughts) in a supportive way.
    *   [ ] Changes in user perspective or re-framed narratives can be noted/updated in the AI's contextual understanding (details to be defined with memory system).

6.  **Integration with Advanced Memory & Context:**
    *   [ ] All interactions with the Mirror Steward are informed by the five-vector memory system and Weaviate integration.
    *   [ ] The AI's responses demonstrate recall and understanding of relevant past user data.

7.  **User Control and Boundaries:**
    *   [ ] Users can set boundaries on topics they don't want to discuss with the AI.
    *   [ ] Users can pause or end interactions with the Mirror Steward at any time.
    *   [ ] Clear information is provided on how the AI uses personal data for these interactions.

## Notes:

*   The success of the Mirror Steward AI hinges on its ability to be genuinely helpful and build trust.
*   Ethical considerations regarding AI influence, user autonomy, and data privacy are paramount.
*   This feature will require sophisticated NLP, NLU, and NLG capabilities, tightly integrated with the memory system.
*   The "re-authoring" aspect needs careful design to be supportive and avoid being prescriptive or pathologizing.
