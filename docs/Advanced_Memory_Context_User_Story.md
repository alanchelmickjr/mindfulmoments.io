# User Story: Advanced Memory & Context

**As a** user seeking a deeply personalized and understanding wellness companion,
**I want** MindfulMoments.io to utilize an advanced memory system, powered by a five-vector model (time-location, emotional, task/activity, contextual) and integrated with Weaviate,
**So that** the Mirror Steward AI can demonstrate profound contextual understanding of my history, recognize nuanced patterns in my experiences, and provide more relevant, insightful, and truly personalized guidance for my emotional well-being and self-reflection journey.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1.  **Five-Vector Memory Model Implementation:**
    *   [ ] **Time-Location Vector:** The system captures and stores data related to when and where events, check-ins, or interactions occur (e.g., timestamp, approximate location if shared).
    *   [ ] **Emotional Vector:** The system stores data from emotional check-ins, including AI-detected emotions, user-confirmed emotions, and intensity.
    *   [ ] **Task/Activity Vector:** The system can log user-defined tasks, activities, or significant events (e.g., "attended a stressful meeting," "completed a guided meditation").
    *   [ ] **Contextual Vector (General):** The system captures broader contextual information, such as weather, news sentiment (if integrated), or other environmental factors that might influence the user's state.
    *   [ ] **Contextual Vector (Interaction-Specific):** The system remembers the context of ongoing conversations and interactions with the Mirror Steward AI (e.g., topics discussed, questions asked, advice given).

2.  **Weaviate Integration:**
    *   [ ] The five-vector memory data is structured and stored effectively within a Weaviate vector database.
    *   [ ] The system can efficiently query Weaviate to retrieve relevant past memories and contextual information based on current interactions or queries.
    *   [ ] Semantic search capabilities of Weaviate are utilized to find related memories even if not explicitly linked.

3.  **Contextual Understanding in AI:**
    *   [ ] The Mirror Steward AI actively uses the retrieved memory and context from Weaviate to inform its responses and guidance.
    *   [ ] The AI can reference past emotional states, activities, or discussions when relevant (e.g., "I remember you mentioned feeling overwhelmed last Tuesday...").
    *   [ ] The AI demonstrates an understanding of patterns over time (e.g., "I've noticed you often feel more positive after your morning walks.").

4.  **Personalized Insights & Guidance:**
    *   [ ] Based on the advanced memory, the AI can offer more tailored insights and suggestions.
    *   [ ] The system can help users identify connections between different aspects of their five-vector memory (e.g., how certain activities correlate with emotional states at specific times).

5.  **User Control & Transparency (Memory):**
    *   [ ] Users have a way to understand what kind of information is being stored in their memory profile (without necessarily seeing raw vector data).
    *   [ ] Users have options to manage their memory, such as forgetting specific events or periods, in line with privacy principles (details to be further defined in "Mirror Steward Integration" and privacy policies).

6.  **Performance & Scalability:**
    *   [ ] Memory retrieval and AI processing remain performant even as the user's memory data grows.
    *   [ ] The Weaviate integration is configured for scalability.

## Notes:

*   This advanced memory system is critical for differentiating MindfulMoments.io and enabling the Mirror Steward AI to be a truly effective and empathetic companion.
*   The interplay between the five vectors will allow for rich, multi-faceted understanding of the user's life.
*   Ethical considerations around data storage, access, and user control are paramount and will be detailed further.
