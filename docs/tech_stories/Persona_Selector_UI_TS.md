# Technical User Story: Persona Selector UI & Interaction

**As a** developer implementing the Persona Selector feature,
**I want** a clear specification for the user interface elements and interaction flows,
**So that** I can build an intuitive and accessible way for users to browse and select AI personas within the application.

---

## Requirements:

1.  **Entry Point:**
    *   [ ] The Persona Selector is accessible from a prominent location in the main application interface (e.g., a settings menu, a dedicated section in the conversation view).

2.  **Persona List Display:**
    *   [ ] Display a list or grid of available personas.
    *   [ ] Each persona item includes:
        *   Persona Name (e.g., "Mirror Steward").
        *   A brief descriptive phrase or tagline (e.g., "Your Reflective Guide").
        *   Optionally, a small icon or visual cue representing the persona.

3.  **Active Persona Indicator:**
    *   [ ] Clearly visually distinguish the currently active persona from others in the list.

4.  **Persona Details View (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   [ ] Upon selecting (but not activating) a persona from the list, display a more detailed view or modal.
    *   [ ] This view includes:
        *   Full Persona Name.
        *   Detailed description of the persona's style, focus, and intended use.
        *   Optionally, a sample interaction snippet or audio preview (if voice is integrated).
        *   A clear "Select Persona" or "Activate" button.

5.  **Selection Confirmation:**
    *   [ ] Upon activating a new persona, provide visual feedback confirming the change (e.g., a temporary notification, updating the active indicator).

6.  **Accessibility:**
    *   [ ] The UI is navigable and usable with keyboard and screen readers.
    *   [ ] Sufficient color contrast is used for text and interactive elements.

7.  **Responsiveness:**
    *   [ ] The Persona Selector UI adapts gracefully to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Edge Cases & Considerations:

*   What happens if there is only one persona available? (The selector might be hidden or show only the single option).
*   How is the loading state handled if fetching personas takes time?
*   How are errors displayed if persona data fails to load?

---

## Documentation Requirements:

*   [ ] Document the UI component structure and props.
*   [ ] Document the state management for the active persona.
*   [ ] Provide examples of how to integrate the Persona Selector component into different parts of the app.
