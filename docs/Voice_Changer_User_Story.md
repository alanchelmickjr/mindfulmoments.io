# User Story: AI Voice Changer

**As a** user interacting with the AI,
**I want** to be able to select and change the AI's voice from a variety of options,
**So that** I can personalize my auditory experience, choose a voice that I find pleasant or suitable for the interaction, and potentially match the voice to the selected AI persona.

---

## Acceptance Criteria:

1.  **Voice Selection Interface:**
    *   [ ] The application provides a clear and accessible user interface for selecting an AI voice.
    *   [ ] This interface could be part of general settings, or closely integrated with the Persona Selector if voices are tied to personas.
    *   [ ] Each available voice option is presented with a descriptive name (e.g., "Serene", "Energetic", "Deep Resonant") and ideally a brief audio sample.
    *   [ ] The currently active voice is clearly indicated.

2.  **Variety of Voice Options:**
    *   [ ] A selection of distinct voice options, leveraging Hume API's capabilities, is available.
    *   [ ] These voices should vary in characteristics such as gender, tone, pitch, and speaking style.
    *   [ ] (Consider) The initial set of voices should be curated for quality and appropriateness for mindful interactions.

3.  **Hume API Integration for Voice Synthesis:**
    *   [ ] The selected voice's configuration (e.g., Hume voice ID, specific parameters) is used when synthesizing AI speech via the Hume API.
    *   [ ] The application correctly instructs the Hume API to use the chosen voice for all text-to-speech output from the AI.
    *   [ ] [`app/api/voiceConfigs/route.ts`](app/api/voiceConfigs/route.ts:1) and [`utils/voiceConfig.ts`](utils/voiceConfig.ts:1) will likely be involved in managing and applying these voice configurations.

4.  **Interaction with Persona Selector:**
    *   [ ] **Option A (Persona-driven voice):** Each AI Persona (defined in [`docs/Persona_Selector_User_Story.md`](docs/Persona_Selector_User_Story.md:1)) can have a default or recommended voice. Selecting a persona automatically applies its associated voice.
    *   [ ] **Option B (Independent voice selection):** Users can select a voice independently of the persona, allowing for mix-and-match.
    *   [ ] **Option C (Hybrid):** Personas have a default voice, but users can override it with a custom voice selection.
    *   [ ] The chosen approach must be clearly defined and implemented consistently. The backend persona management ([`docs/tech_stories/Persona_Backend_Admin_TS.md`](docs/tech_stories/Persona_Backend_Admin_TS.md:1)) should support storing voice preferences per persona if Option A or C is chosen.

5.  **Persistence of Selection:**
    *   [ ] The user's last selected voice (or persona-driven voice setting) is remembered across sessions.

6.  **Real-time Voice Change (Optional but Desirable):**
    *   [ ] If technically feasible, changing the voice selection should apply immediately to subsequent AI speech without requiring a session restart.

7.  **Extensibility:**
    *   [ ] The system is designed to allow for the addition of new voice options in the future, potentially managed via an admin panel alongside persona voice configurations.

## Notes:

*   The quality and naturalness of the voices offered by Hume API will be critical to this feature's success.
*   The relationship between Voice Changer and Persona Selector needs careful consideration to ensure a coherent user experience. Option C (Hybrid) often provides a good balance of guidance and flexibility.
*   Technical feasibility of audio samples in the selection UI should be investigated.
*   Consider how custom voice configurations (e.g., pitch, speed adjustments beyond pre-defined voices) might be handled if desired in the future.
