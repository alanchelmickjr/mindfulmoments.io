# UI Design Specification: AI Voice Selection

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the User Interface (UI) design for the AI Voice Selection feature in the Mindful Moments application. The goal is to provide users with a clear, accessible, and intuitive way to choose and preview different AI voices, enhancing their personalized experience.

This design adheres to the requirements specified in the [AI Voice Changer User Story](docs/Voice_Changer_User_Story.md:1).

## 2. Design Principles

The UI design for voice selection will be guided by the following principles:

*   **Clarity**: Users should easily understand how to find, preview, and select voices.
*   **Accessibility**: The interface must be usable by people with diverse abilities, adhering to WCAG guidelines.
*   **Intuitiveness**: The process of changing a voice should feel natural and require minimal effort.
*   **Feedback**: Users should receive clear confirmation of their selections.
*   **Consistency**: The design should align with the overall look and feel of the Mindful Moments application.

## 3. Location and Access

The AI Voice Selection UI will be accessible in two primary ways, supporting the hybrid model (Option C from the user story) for persona and voice interaction:

1.  **Within Persona Settings**: When a user is viewing or customizing a selected AI Persona, an option to "Change Voice" or "Voice Options" will be available. This keeps voice selection contextually relevant to the persona.
2.  **Global Application Settings**: A dedicated "Voice Settings" section within the main application settings will allow users to manage their preferred voice independently of a specific persona, or to set a global default override.

## 4. UI Components and Layout

The Voice Selection interface itself could be presented as a modal dialog or a dedicated settings panel. It will feature the following components:

### 4.1. Voice List

A scrollable list displaying all available AI voices. Each item in the list will represent a single voice option and will include:

*   **Voice Name**: A descriptive and appealing name (e.g., "Aura - Calm & Gentle", "Nova - Bright & Clear", "Echo - Deep & Resonant").
    *   *Example Format*: `[Voice Name] - [Brief Descriptor]`
*   **Audio Sample Button**: A clearly marked "Play/Preview" icon (e.g., a speaker icon or play button).
    *   Clicking this button will play a short, standardized audio clip showcasing the voice's characteristics.
    *   The button should toggle to a "Pause" or "Stop" icon during playback.
*   **Selection Indicator**:
    *   Radio buttons or a similar single-select mechanism will be used for choosing a voice.
    *   The currently selected voice will be clearly highlighted.

### 4.2. Persona Default Indication

*   If accessed via Persona Settings, the persona's default voice will be clearly indicated (e.g., with a "Default for [Persona Name]" label next to it).
*   An option to "Revert to Persona Default" or "Use Persona's Voice" will be available if the user has selected a different voice.

### 4.3. Current Selection Display

*   A persistent display (e.g., at the top of the modal/panel) will show the "Currently Active Voice: [Selected Voice Name]".

### 4.4. Confirmation Actions

*   "Save" or "Apply" button to confirm the voice selection and close the interface.
*   "Cancel" button to discard changes and close the interface.

## 5. Interaction Flow

1.  **Accessing the UI**:
    *   User navigates to Persona settings and clicks "Change Voice."
    *   OR, user navigates to global Application Settings and selects "Voice Settings."
2.  **Browsing Voices**:
    *   User scrolls through the list of available voices.
3.  **Previewing a Voice**:
    *   User clicks the "Play/Preview" button next to a voice name.
    *   A short audio sample plays. The user can stop/pause the sample.
    *   Only one audio sample can be played at a time.
4.  **Selecting a Voice**:
    *   User clicks on a voice option (e.g., clicks the radio button or the voice entry itself).
    *   The selection indicator updates to highlight the chosen voice.
    *   The "Currently Active Voice" display updates.
5.  **Confirming Selection**:
    *   User clicks "Save" or "Apply."
    *   The UI closes, and the selected voice is applied to subsequent AI speech.
    *   A brief confirmation message (e.g., "Voice updated to [Selected Voice Name]") may be displayed.
6.  **Reverting to Persona Default (if applicable)**:
    *   User clicks "Revert to Persona Default."
    *   The selection changes to the persona's default voice, and the UI updates accordingly.

## 6. Accessibility Considerations

*   **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements (voice list, play buttons, selection controls, action buttons) must be fully navigable and operable using a keyboard.
*   **Screen Reader Support**:
    *   Proper ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label` for buttons, `aria-describedby` for voice descriptions, `role="radiogroup"` for voice list) will be used.
    *   Voice names and descriptions will be read out by screen readers.
    *   The state of play buttons (playing/paused) and selected voice will be announced.
*   **Focus Indicators**: Clear and visible focus indicators will be present on all interactive elements when they receive keyboard focus.
*   **Color Contrast**: Text and UI elements will adhere to WCAG AA contrast ratio guidelines.
*   **Audio Sample Transcripts (Optional but Recommended)**: Consider providing text transcripts for audio samples for users who cannot access audio.

## 7. Visual Sketch (Textual Description)

Imagine a modal dialog titled "Select AI Voice":

```
+------------------------------------------------------+
| Select AI Voice                            [ X ]   |
+------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                      |
| Currently Active Voice: Nova - Bright & Clear        |
| [ ] Revert to Persona Default (if applicable)        |

|------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                      |
|   Voice Options:                                     |
|                                                      |
|   (o) Aura - Calm & Gentle      [ Play Icon ]        |
|       A soothing voice, perfect for relaxation.      |
|                                                      |
|   (*) Nova - Bright & Clear     [ Play Icon ]        |
|       An energetic and clear voice for everyday use. |
|                                                      |
|   (o) Echo - Deep & Resonant    [ Play Icon ]        |
|       A commanding and deep voice.                   |
|                                                      |
|   ... (scrollable list) ...                          |
|                                                      |
+------------------------------------------------------+
|                               [ Cancel ] [ Apply ]   |
+------------------------------------------------------+
```
*   `(o)` represents an unselected radio button.
*   `(*)` represents a selected radio button.
*   `[ Play Icon ]` is a clickable button to hear the sample.
*   `[ X ]` is the close button for the modal.

## 8. Future Considerations

*   **Custom Voice Parameters**: The UI could be extended to allow fine-tuning of voice characteristics (pitch, speed) if the API supports it.
*   **Search/Filter**: For a large number of voices, a search or filter capability might be added.

This design aims to provide a solid foundation for the AI Voice Selection feature, ensuring a positive user experience.
