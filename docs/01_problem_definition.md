# Problem Definition: MindfulMoments.io Call Drops

## 1. Overview

The MindfulMoments.io application is experiencing a critical issue where the voice call to the AI agent terminates prematurely ("stops right away"). This behavior indicates a potential problem with maintaining the audio stream or the underlying call session management.

## 2. Reported Symptoms

*   **Primary Symptom:** The phone call/voice interaction with the agent disconnects almost immediately after initiation.
    *   User Description: "the phone call to the agent stops right away, like it is not holding the stream open"
    *   // TEST: Verify that initiating a call results in a quick disconnection.
*   **Console Output:** No error messages or warnings are reported in the browser's developer console when the call drops.
    *   User Confirmation: User states "no message ever show in the console".
    *   // TEST: Confirm no client-side errors are logged during call failure.

## 3. Suspected Cause & Recent Changes

*   The issues reportedly started after AI-assisted modifications were made to the application.
    *   User Description: "I asked daddy1 and gemini to put all the buttons in one dock and implement any missing functionality... they destroyed the projects continuity"
*   Specific changes mentioned:
    *   Consolidation of UI buttons into a single "dock."
    *   Implementation of unspecified "missing functionality."
    *   // TEST: Identify code sections related to button controls and call initiation/management that were recently modified.

## 4. Affected Functionality

*   **Core Functionality Affected:** Voice call interaction with the AI agent.
*   **Expected Behavior:** The voice call should remain active, allowing for a continuous conversation with the agent.
    *   // TEST: Define expected call duration and stability metrics.

## 5. Next Steps for Investigation

*   Investigate server-side logs for errors, as no client-side errors are reported in the browser console.
*   Identify the specific files/modules modified by the AI tools related to call handling and UI controls.
