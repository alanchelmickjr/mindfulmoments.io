# User Story: AI Persona Selector

**As a** user who values variety and control in my interactions,
**I want** MindfulMoments.io to offer a persona selector that allows me to choose from different AI personalities for the Mirror Steward (and potentially other AI interactions),
**So that** I can tailor my experience to my current mood or needs, explore different interaction styles, and feel more engaged and understood by the application.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1.  **Persona Availability & Selection UI:**
    *   [ ] The application provides a clear and accessible user interface for selecting an AI persona.
    *   [ ] At least one default persona (e.g., "Mirror Steward") is available.
    *   [ ] Each available persona is presented with a name and a brief, evocative description of its interaction style or focus (e.g., "Reflective Guide," "Calm Coach," "Inquisitive Explorer").
    *   [ ] The currently active persona is clearly indicated to the user.
    *   [ ] Users can easily switch between available personas.
    *   [ ] Detailed UI/UX specifications for the persona selector interface are documented in [`docs/tech_stories/Persona_Selector_UI_TS.md`](docs/tech_stories/Persona_Selector_UI_TS.md:1).

2.  **Backend Persona Management:**
    *   [ ] Personas are defined with distinct characteristics, including but not limited to:
        *   System prompts or base instructions for the LLM.
        *   Preferred communication style (e.g., tone, vocabulary, directness).
        *   Specific areas of focus or expertise (if applicable).
        *   Potentially, default voice characteristics (to be integrated with the voice changer feature).
    *   [ ] Persona definitions are stored in a manageable way (e.g., configuration files, database entries, potentially manageable via the future admin tool).
    *   [ ] The system can load and apply the selected persona's characteristics to the AI model at runtime.

3.  **Integration with AI Interaction:**
    *   [ ] The selected persona significantly influences the AI's responses, behavior, and communication style during interactions.
    *   [ ] The application's AI (e.g., Mirror Steward) adapts its interaction based on the active persona.
    *   [ ] If multiple AI interaction points exist, the persona selection could apply globally or be specific to certain interactions (to be defined).

4.  **Hume API Integration (for Prompts):**
    *   [ ] The persona definition can include specific system prompts or configurations compatible with the Hume API (or other underlying LLM APIs).
    *   [ ] When a persona is selected, its associated prompts are correctly loaded and used for AI interactions via the Hume API.

5.  **Persistence of Selection:**
    *   [ ] The user's last selected persona is remembered across sessions (unless they choose to reset to default).

6.  **Extensibility:**
    *   [ ] The system is designed to allow for the addition of new personas in the future (potentially via the admin tool).

## Notes:

*   This feature enhances user agency and can make interactions feel more dynamic and personalized.
*   The quality and distinctiveness of the available personas will be key to this feature's success.
*   Consider how persona selection might interact with the advanced memory system â€“ does the AI's memory of past interactions get filtered or re-interpreted based on the current persona? (This needs careful thought).
*   The initial set of personas should be thoughtfully curated.
